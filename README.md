# 🛣️ My Road

This repository documents my journey as a computer graphics student and developer.

Here I keep experiments, learning projects, and prototypes related to graphics programming, simulation, and rendering.

## 📚 Currently learning

- 📁 **CppLearning**  
  Core C++ concepts, memory management, math utilities, and low-level experiments.

- 📁 **RayTracing**  
  Ray tracing fundamentals, lighting models, and rendering techniques. It is based on the Ray Tracing in a weekend book series.

- 📁 **ClothSDK**  
  Physics-based cloth simulation engine (now maintained in its own repository):

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a solid foundation in C++ and graphics math
- Learn rendering pipelines
- Develop simulation systems
- Learn graphics APIs such as OpenGl looking forward to Vulkan in the future
