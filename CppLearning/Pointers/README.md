# Pointers

Today i tried to understand what a pointer is. I saw the Cherno video [Pointers in c++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzoFn3dfsPA&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&index=17) and i think that i almost got it. 

They are basically variables that store a memory address.

I'm also trying to improve my English writing because it's a weak point I'm struggling with. So this is a new habit that I want to do for every single program that I could write soon.
