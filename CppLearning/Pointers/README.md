# Pointers

## Pointers
Today I tried to understand what a pointer is. I saw the Cherno's Video [Pointers in c++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzoFn3dfsPA&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&index=17) and I think that I almost got it. 

They are basically variables that store a **memory address**.

I'm also trying to improve my English writing because it's a weak point I'm struggling with. So this is a new habit I want to practice in every program I write from now on.

## References
Today I made a simple implemention of references on a C++ file. 
I learned the use of the **&** operator and the changes that happen when you modify the original variable. 

Basically I just saw the Cherno's Video [References in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzoFn3dfsPA). Because I'm a little bit busy with my university courses.
